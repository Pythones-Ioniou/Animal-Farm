    sar "The animals won't shut up about how freeing it is to finally work for themselves and not some sort of farmer."
    sar "It almost makes me sad that I'm working on ruining this for them..."
    sar "...but it must be done."
    sar "I already made my deal."
    sar "So far, I've decided that the designated leader for the farm is Napoleon."
    sar "He is much more selfish and easy to manipulate than Snowball."
    sar "Snowball has the farm's best interest at heart, but Napoleon has himself over anything."
    sar "Sometimes he resists my consults, but most of the time he complies and does as I say."
    sar "He's even close to naming me his official counselor, all in secret of course."
    sar "It's in his best interest that our alliance stays hidden."
    sar "This way, I can also act as an informant on what the animals say about him."
    sar "I, of course, do not tell him everything."
    sar "Only what is necessary for the plan's execution..."
    sar "Many animals though have been raising questions about the two puppies that Jessie and Bluebell gave birth to."
    sar "They keep asking many questions and it's growing harder and harder to keep their whereabouts secret."
    sar "A lot of questions have been raised about the stolen milk and apples as well but Napoleon made sure to cover our crime."
    sar "Squealer is to make an announcement soon."
